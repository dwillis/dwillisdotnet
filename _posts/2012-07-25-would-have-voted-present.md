If I had been present, I would have been present. It’s like Congressional inception.
personalexplanations:

Rep. Timothy Johnson, R-Ill.:

Mr. Speaker on rollcall No. 490 I was present for all prior and subsequent votes but was off the floor on legislative business and inadvertently missed the vote. I support the underlying concept of non-intervention regarding the subject material, but also feel the amendment was excessively micromanagerial and did not accomplish mine and the sponsor’s objectives. Had I been present, I would have voted “present.”
