I spent last weekend back in New York to attend the NYTimes Hack Day. It was a lot of fun.

My project wasn’t anywhere near as exciting as most of the others and with a late start I didn’t get to finish it in time to submit.

Well now its up, courtesy of the 6 hour flight to Seattle. Its called The Last Word.

It takes the Homepage feed, grabs the last paragraph, takes the last line and imposes it next to the photograph. Sometimes its a compelling combination, sometimes not.

The feed is freely available as javascript you can pull into your own little web app via a callback. I have a cron job updating it every 30 minutes. The result is uploaded to a Dropbox.
